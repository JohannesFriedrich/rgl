notes on shaders branch

Still to do:
  
   - check all help pages on pkgdown site
   - fix problem on ?subscenes3d: clipplanes not respected.
     They aren't being initialized properly.  countClipPlanes
     looks wrong too:  if two planes are in the same obj, they
     won't be counted.  DONE
   - remove old shader generator code
   - rename defines to all uppercase?

Have checked:

   pages in alpha order from subsceneInfo.html to writeWebGL.html.
