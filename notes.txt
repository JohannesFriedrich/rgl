notes on shaders branch

Still to do:
  
   - example(contourLines3d) has shading wrong. Also in master,
     so not related to shaders.
   - the sizing looks wrong in `example(rglShared)` and `example(asRow)`.  Probably
     not related to shaders.
   - the initial display of the mouse mode is wrong in `example(rglMouse)`.  Probably not related to shaders.

Have checked:

   pages in alpha order from makeDependency.html to writeWebGL.html.

Fixed:

   - fix problem on ?subscenes3d: clipplanes not respected.
     They aren't being initialized properly.  countClipPlanes
     looks wrong too:  if two planes are in the same obj, they
     won't be counted.  DONE
   - rename defines to all uppercase DONE
   - remove old shader generator code DONE
   - check all help pages on pkgdown site DONE
